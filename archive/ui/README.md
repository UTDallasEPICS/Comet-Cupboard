# *For future teams*

The front is written in Svelte and the development environment is vite,  
but since Vite is already set up you don't have to mess with it much.

## Recommended setup and IDE
We recommend you use **[VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)** going forward, since it is a powerful IDE and the extensions are very useful when writing code. Make sure you **[install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)** since it is required to install dependencies and run Svelte on your machine. If NodeJS is already installed, run this command to upgrade it to the most recent version `npm update -g npm`. If you are using Linux use `sudo apt install nodejs` or a nodejs version control application.

We also use a UI framework called Svelte Material UI(SMUI) which gives Svelte components like buttons, tables, modals, tabs, and other UI objects. 
The UI framework makes components automatically reactive and styled, so we recommend using the SMUI components as much as possible. Some SMUI Components are already installed, but since you have to install each component individually with SMUI, you might have to install a SMUI component with npm. **[Learn more here](https://sveltematerialui.com/demo/quick-guide/)**

## Some tutorials we recommend
Since **Svelte** and **SMUI** are big parts of the front-end development we recommend spending a lot of time getting comfortable with them we also recommend you touch up on your CSS skills to change the style
