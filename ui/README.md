# *For future teams*

The front is written in Svelte and the development environment is vite,  
but since vite is already set up you don't have to mess with it much

## Recommended setup and IDE
We recommend you use **VScode** going forward, since we are using VScode and the extension mainly apply to vscode.  
Make sure you have the most recent version of **NodeJS** installed since it is required to install dependencies and run Svelte  
If you can install **[NodeJs here on any OS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)**  
or if you are using Linux use `sudo apt install nodejs` or a nodejs version control application

### Some tutorials we recommend

---

Since **Svelte** is a big part of the front end development we recommend spending a lot of time getting comfortable with it we also recommend you touch up on your CSS skills for styling changes
